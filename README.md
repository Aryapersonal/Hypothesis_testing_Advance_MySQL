- **Remote Work**: As most respondents prefer in-office or hybrid work arrangements, companies should prioritize creating conducive office spaces while offering hybrid work options.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into the preferences and frustrations of respondents related to career, salary expectations, work-life balance, and workplace environments. By analyzing the data through hypothesis testing in MySQL, the study reveals strong preferences for socially responsible companies, significant frustrations with unclear work goals and unsupportive managers, and a low tolerance for abusive work environments. These insights can guide HR strategies and organizational practices to improve employee satisfaction, productivity, and retention.
